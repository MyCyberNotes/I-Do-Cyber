#I-Do-Cyber Lab

Welcome to my cybersecurity development lab. This repository serves as the foundation for my journey into **Web Development**, **Security Research**, and **Bug Bounty Hunting**.

## 🛠️ Environment
- **OS:** OpenBSD (Secure by Design)
- **Editor:** vi / mg
- **Version Control:** Git via SSH (Ed25519)
- **Focus:** Raw HTML, CSS, and Security Fundamentals

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
1. **Web Fundamentals:** Understanding the DOM, HTTP headers, and how browsers interpret raw code.
2. **Security Research:** Learning how to identify vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, IDOR) from the inside out.
3. **Bug Bounty Hunting:** Documenting my progress as I learn to hunt for vulnerabilities in a controlled, ethical manner.

## 🚀 Projects
- `index.html` - My first raw development environment landing page.
- *(More projects coming as I progress through the OWASP Top 10!)*
